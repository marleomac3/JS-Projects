# JavaScript Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my JavaScript Projects Portfolio! This repository showcases a selection of my JavaScript projects, demonstrating my skills and experience in web development, programming, and problem-solving. I built these projects to explore various aspects of JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, API integration, and data handling.
